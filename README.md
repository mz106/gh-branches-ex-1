# gh-branches-ex-1 - Brief

Awesome Websites have asked you to review their website. They have been having some styling issues and have pointed out three major issues;

1. The menu items in the top menu are not changing on hover. 

2. The layout of the main section is poor and not visulay appealing. 

3. The footer menu is vertical and not horizontal, and the list decoration needs to be removed.

Please review the website and make changes to align with the images given in the reference folder. 

No new HTML tags, classes or IDs will need to be created.

1. Changes to the top nav menu should be made on the branch 

    feature/header
